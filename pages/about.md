<p>Hi! I'm Scott!</p>
I am an undergraduate student entering my senior year at <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer</a> (RPI), studying <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/">Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://www.hass.rpi.edu/pl/gaming">Games and Simulation Arts & Sciences</a>.

For this summer, I am a Software Engineering Intern at Google in Seattle, where I've been helping to add additional WebGL debugging tools to their open source <a href="http://google.github.io/tracing-framework/">Web Tracing Framework</a>.

Before working for Google, I spent three summers interning at <a href="http://www.mitre.org/">The MITRE Corporation</a> working on social network analysis, research tools, and other fun projects. Take a look at my resume for more details.
