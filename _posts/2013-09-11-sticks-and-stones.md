<h3>Overview</h3>

This game was made for <a href="http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/~destem/gamedev/">Game Development 1</a> in two weeks time. We were tasked with creating a "story-like shmup-like" (Shoot 'em up) in a creative setting using Python and <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a>.

Sticks & Stones is a game about an argument between two children that takes place on a scrolling whiteboard. As their argument escalates, the drawings become more violent. When enemies are defeated, they sometimes leave behind words representative of the current state of the argument.
