<h3>Overview</h3>

I created these ten levels using <a href="http://www.thinkwithportals.com/">Portal 2</a>'s <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Puzzle_Creator">Puzzle Creator</a> for <a href="http://www.cm.rpi.edu/pl/people-590/lee-sheldon">Lee Sheldon</a>'s Level Design course in one month. With these levels, I explored time related gameplay mechanics while telling a story about working tirelessly to rescue the companion cubes that have been stolen away. My classmates voted them the winner of our team choices awards.

View the levels on the Steam Workshop <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=140584138">here</a>! Portal 2 is required to play.

<h3>My Contributions</h3>

The Puzzle Creator does not offer scripting support, so I constructed timing mechanisms out of <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Excursion_Funnel">excursion funnels</a>, <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Weighted_Storage_Cube">cubes</a>, and <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Heavy_Duty_Super-Colliding_Super_Button">buttons</a>. Throughout the levels, <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Hard_Light_Bridge">light bridges</a>, excursion funnels, and <a href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Laser_Field">laser fields</a> turn on and off automatically using these timers. Where applicable, lasers are used to indicate the status of timers.

These levels include:

* A narrative being told in the background through gameplay events
* Timed navigation puzzles
* Two constantly shifting mazes
* Two races against the clock
* A giant pinball machine
* Environments carefully designed for gameplay and thematic reasons
