<h3>Overview</h3>

This was my final project for <a href="http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~wrf/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComputerGraphicsFall2013/ComputerGraphicsFall2013">Computer Graphics</a>. I worked with <a href="http://www.tinycranes.com/">Kevin Fung</a> on this project over a one month period. We used <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, and we entered this project into GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/github/game-off-2013">Game Off 2013</a> contest.

To complete each level, players must position the pushers and splitters such that each flow reaches the sink of the same color.

<h3>My Contributions</h3>

I coded the particle mechanics and designed all ten levels along with the appearance of all visible elements.
